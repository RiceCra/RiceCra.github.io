          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>AA™ was founded on the basis that our customers would never want to ever think about us again, all of our services are picked through lottery and depend on if our office feels like doing something that day. Here is a list of the many hardships we endured to maintain customer satisfaction;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Refill the coffee maker.</li>
              <li>Tell the motel we put our guest at not to give them our contact information so that the customer can practice their communication skills.</li>
              <li>Refuse refunds so that they can experience the culture.</li>
              <li>Get the Janitor at the office to do the accounting.</li>
              <li>Send people to the wrong locations to ensure that they can experience the country to itś fullest.</li>
            </ul>
